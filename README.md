# Grape Service

As I transition my projects to more manageable services, I'm making a [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape)-based [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) service.

*TODO:*
* Add docker for one-line deployment
* Add messaging queue (like RabbitMQ) for communicating between services
